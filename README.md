# About Dataset

After studying this paper: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-34111-3_44 This dataset was created as a proposed modification to the khaleeji-all-50-men dataset they were using.

This dataset is Egyptian dialect instead of Khaleeji spoken by 50 mixed-gender people, to avoid biases. Speakersâ€™ age range from 15 to 50 years and the dataset consists of 30 females and 20 males, which creates better coverage to the problem than the dataset already used.
